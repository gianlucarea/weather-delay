# weather-delay
This is a study on different algorithms to find two algorithms, one for classification and one for regression, to predict delays between stops based on departure delay and weather. The main aim is to improve the attractiveness of choosing rail travel instead of cars to lower carbon footprint.

Starting from the file 02-Data Analytics, I could not update the files used in the preprocessing.
To take the file for preprocessing, you could visit the following sites: 
- [Weather Data](https://open-meteo.com/)
- [Tuscany Train Data](https://www.transit.land/feeds/f-sp-trenitaliaspa)
- [Italian Delay Data](https://trainstats.altervista.org/)
